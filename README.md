# Project: Digit Classification

In this project I will implement a naive Bayesian classifier for a set of scanned handwritten digit images. My task is to guess which digit a handwritten image is supposed to be. Given a set, or corpus, of training images which have already been labeled with the correct digits. The goal of a classifier is to compute the most likely digit for an unclassified image, by breaking the image apart into features and ranking each digit by how closely it matches the image.
