# Project 1: Digit Classification

In this project you will implement a naive Bayesian classifier for a set of scanned handwritten digit images. Your task is to guess which digit a handwritten image is supposed to be. To help, you are given a set, or corpus, of training images which have already been labeled with the correct digits. The goal of a classifier is to compute the most likely digit for an unclassified image, by breaking the image apart into features and ranking each digit by how closely it matches the image.

The detailed description for this project can be found on the [course webpage](https://sites.google.com/trinity.edu/csci2322-fl22/individual-projects/project-1-digit-classification).
